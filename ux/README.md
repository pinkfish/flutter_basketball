# Flutter Basketball Stats

_A whelksoft project_

A nifty flutter project to give happy stats about basketballl

## Getting Started

This app will run and show basketball stats.  It will use the local
sql lite to store all the data, however to work even better you
will need to hook up firebase to get better results.

Tracks stats by player and by game, showing season summaries for the
team and by player.  Show nifty graphs of the data over time in a game
as well as data for a player indexed by game.  Useful for seeing
trends and other information about your basketball teams.

The code for this is written in flutter and runs on android and ios.
There is a CI build setup for the checkins along with fastlane for
deployment to the apple/google store.  Customise and enjoy.
